# Facial_Expression_Recognition_with_Keras
This is a project which detects 7 universal facial expressions namely Happy, Surprise, Sad, Disgust, Fear, Anger, and Contempt.
In this project, expression can be determined by two methods: by feeding a short sample video of 15-20 seconds and the program will automatically detect the expressions at each frame, and the other way is through real time with webcam. Both methods are done in this project.
